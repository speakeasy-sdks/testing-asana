# BatchRequestActionData

For `GET` requests, this should be a map of query parameters you would have normally passed in the URL. Options and pagination are not accepted here; put them in `options` instead. For `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` methods, this should be the content you would have normally put in the data field of the body.
